# discourse-topic-list-previews-theme
Theme component which ports much of the functionality of the much-loved Topic List Previews plugin to a Theme Component.

Known Issue:

- Because of the way I've opted to render a masonry style tiles display (it's very efficient), on Chromium based browsers there will be a limit to how far you can scroll until the layout messes up.  It is fixed in Chrome Beta (Version 96) so should soon not be an issue for most users.
